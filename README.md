### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You found my professional portfolio! :D 

I'm currently open for work.

Keep in mind this is a work in progress. But for now, check some of my awesome projects:

### Tech proficiency

**Games Developed Counter**: 7.

I've worked mostly in front web development using Angular. I'm currently trying my hand at some React. I've also worked multiple times towards mobile and responsive UIs.

### Project highlights

Some of the most important projects I've worked on:

- **[Cinema App](https://github.com/fefu-marquez/cinema-app)**: this is a very simple app that I've created for a technical interview. Check it out.
- **[AgilMente](https://github.com/Ultimo-Momento-Responsable/agilmente)**: this is the thesis for my degree in Systems Engineering. It is an application for neurological rehabilitation. It consists of a control panel for the medical staff where the patient's data and progress are followed for diagnosis and to make adjustments on the process of neurorehabilitation; a mobile application for the patient to exercise on; and an API REST for integration between the two and other services. There is also a lot of investigation regarding following the patients progress that we compiled in a published paper and a few data analysis repositories with Jupyter Notebook. (I'll update the README so that it includes links to everything soon.)
- **[Xcapit](https://gitlab.com/xcapit-foss/app)**: a crypto wallet app from a company I used to work for. Most of my contributions were in the frontend, although occasionally I would have to integrate blockchain or third-party services, which involved a lot of cryptography work in order to keep the userâ€™s privacy. I also was in charge of integrating Firebase and the implementation of a feature-flag functionality.
